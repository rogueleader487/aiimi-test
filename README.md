### Tech Stack

- .Net 7 for API with EF in memory for temporary data storage
- Angular 15 for the UI layer
- Bootstrap 5 for CSS with minor customisations

### Running the project

The project was built using Visual Studio 2022, once pulled down it should require no manual intervention to compile and run from within VS. The standard ctrl + F5 running should suffice.
